A revolutionary idea that takes garbage disposal to next level. 
This app motivates the user to throw garbage into the garbage that has our hardware integrated into it, before dispoal the user scans the QR code on the garbage can and then disposes it, after disposing the app provides the user with credits based on the amount of garbage thrown and rewards the user with customised in-app credits that the user can use to buy products from the app marketplace at discounted price.
